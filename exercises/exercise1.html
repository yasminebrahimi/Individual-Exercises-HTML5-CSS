        <h1>Welcome to study at HAMK</h1>
        <h2>Activation Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Activate your user ID before starting your studies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Activate MFA (Multifactor Authentication).</p>
                <p>Instructions below:</p>
                <p>Not until after receiving the “HAMK user ID activation” e-mail from the “Identity Services (no reply)” address can you activate your ID in HAMK's information systems. (Prior to this, you have already received a message from student services about accepting a place to study at HAMK, but at that time the credentials cannot be activated yet).</p>
                <p>Please note that if it is less than 28 days since the end of your previous study right, you may not receive a message at all, and the credentials will continue to be valid as normal.</p>
                <p>Usernames will not be sent to you by email; you can find out the credentials from the HAMK Identification service (remember to save this for yourself during activation).</p>
                <p>Activate your student ID before the start of your studies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructions to activate user account</li>
                    <li>Instructions to enable multi-factor authentication</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>For more information and in case of an error, please contact ServiceDesk. You can log in to ServiceDesk if you already have an HAMK student ID. If you don't have an HAMK student ID, please send an email, that creates a ticket automatically: <a href="mailto:it@hamk.fi">it@hamk.fi</a>. Include a subject and detailed description!</p>
