                <p>Please note that if it is<i>less than 28 days</i>since the end of your previous study right, you may not receive a message at all, and the credentials will continue to be valid as normal.</p>
                <p><mark>Usernames will not be sent to you by email</mark>; you can find out the <u>credentials</u> from the HAMK Identification service (remember to save this for yourself during activation).</p>
                <p>Activate your student ID before the start of your studies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):</p>
