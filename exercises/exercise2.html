        <h2>Activation Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Activate your user ID before starting your studies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Activate MFA (Multifactor Authentication).</p>
                <p>Instructions below:</p>
                <p>Not until after receiving the “HAMK user ID activation” e-mail from the “Identity Services (no reply)” address can you activate your ID in HAMK's information systems. (Prior to this, you have already received a message from student services about accepting a place to study at HAMK, but at that time the credentials cannot be activated yet).</p>
                <p>Please note that if it is less than 28 days since the end of your previous study right, you may not receive a message at all, and the credentials will continue to be valid as normal.</p>
                <p>Usernames will not be sent to you by email; you can find out the credentials from the HAMK Identification service (remember to save this for yourself during activation).</p>
                <p>Activate your student ID before the start of your studies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Instructions to activate user account</li>
                    <li>Instructions to enable multi-factor authentication</li>
                </ul>
